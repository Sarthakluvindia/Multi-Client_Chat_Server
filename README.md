# Multi-Client_Chat_Server
Multi-Client Chat Server is a Server based chatting platform. It is an application where a client (user) is able to Signup/Login into the chat server. As the user Signup into the chat server, his/her information is stored into the database (here MySQL). Then using the same database, we pick up the values and Login into the chat server.  
The client then has to connect to the server, then he is able to see all the users connected to that server. He /She can then select the user and can send them the message. The receiver will receive the message, which will also be printed in the server. 
If any third user is also connected to the user, he/she would not be able to see the conversation are the first two users are having.
